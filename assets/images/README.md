Place a header image for the app's home/parallax header here.

Filename to use in code: plantation-header.jpg
Path: assets/images/plantation-header.jpg

Recommended free stock sources (choose one and download a high-resolution horizontal image ~ 1200–2000px wide):
- Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/plantation
- Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/search/plantation/
- Pixabay: https://pixabay.com/images/search/plantation/

Instructions:
1. Pick an image from one of the links above (search for "plantation", "tea plantation", "paddy field", "agriculture landscape").
2. Download the image (prefer JPG or PNG).
3. Save it as `plantation-header.jpg` in this folder: `assets/images/`.

Optional: Use a darker image or reduce brightness before saving so overlay text remains readable. The code applies a subtle dark overlay (`rgba(0,0,0,0.18)`) over the header to improve contrast.
